<p>This is a work-in-progress, and if you find errors or problems, go ahead and fix them!</p>

<p>The first set of pages describes the data model for MeSH in RDF.  Each page gives a sample of XML followed by the corresponding RDF that is produced from that XML, in both a diagram and in turtle format.  Finally, the pages include the SPARQL query or queries that can be used to generate the RDF for the particular example.</p>

<p>All of the examples are drawn from the XML contained within the sample XML files (<a href="https://github.com/HHS/mesh-rdf/blob/master/samples/desc-samples.xml">desc-samples.xml</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HHS/mesh-rdf/blob/master/samples/qual-samples.xml">qual-samples.xml</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/HHS/mesh-rdf/blob/master/samples/supp-samples.xml">supp-samples.xml</a>), so it should be possible to run the XSLTs on just those samples, without downloading the entire MeSH dataset, in order to verify that the documentation is correct.</p>

<p>The drawings are all done with <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com">LucidChart</a>, and the original files are editable on Google Drive.  To edit any of them, first create an account on LucidChart thatâ€™s linked to your Google account, and then click on the link under the drawing. Then, export it as a png and put it into the doc folder in the repository.</p>
