### MeSH RDF 2014 (Beta) Release Notes

Sometime between late May and early June of 2015, 2014 MeSH RDF will be replaced by 2015 MeSH RDF.  **2014 MeSH RDF will not be archived and the data will no longer be available**.
The new URL structure to access the latest MeSH RDF graph will be id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh, which will serve 2015 MeSH RDF.

### Data Changes:

The table below lists changes in classes and predicates as of 2014 MeSH.  These changes will go into effect when 2015 MeSH RDF goes live.
