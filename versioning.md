MeSH has a major update once a year. Supplementary Concept Records are added regularly throughout the year. MeSH RDF's release schedule will follow MeSH's release schedule. See [[where is MeSH's release schedule documented?]]() for more details.

The current version of MeSH RDF is expressed in the following graph, which includes over X triples:

* <http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh> 

A versioned graph is also available:

<http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh2015>

This graph will be identical to <http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh> until <http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh> updates to 2016 MeSH data in X. Once <http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh> updates to 2016 MeSH, <http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh2015> will become static. NLM will retain no more than three years of versioned graphs.
