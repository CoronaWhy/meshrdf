MeSH has a major update once a year. Supplementary Concept Records are added regularly throughout the year. MeSH RDF's release schedule will follow MeSH's release schedule. See [[where is MeSH's release schedule documented?]]() for more details.

At any given time, MeSH RDF will have a current graph, which expresses the current state of MeSH. MeSH RDF will also have versioned graphs. Current graphs include:

<http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh> (the data)
<http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/schema1.0?> (the schema)
<http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/void> (metadata about MeSH RDF)

A versioned graph is also available. Note that this graph will become static when current MeSH updates to the 2016 version.
