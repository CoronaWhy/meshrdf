To avoid overloading the servers, NLM requires that users of the MeSH RDF beta SPARQL endpoint service send no more than 500 requests per minute per IP address. Requests that exceed this limit will not be serviced, and service to that IP address will not be restored until 30 seconds time has elapsed.

This policy is in place to ensure that the service remains available and accessible to all users. Consult the [SPARQL Request Parameters](./sparql-request-parameters.html) page for help in structuring SPARQL requests. There is a limit of 1,000 results per request. 

If you have a specific use case that requires you to send a large number of requests to the Web service, and thus exceed the request rate limit outlined in this policy, please contact us. NLM staff will evaluate your request and determine if an exception may be granted.
