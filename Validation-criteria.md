Here is a list of things that should be checked in the resultant RDF.  Most of these can be done by the XLSTs during generation, but maybe others will need to be done by SPARQL queries after loading to a triple store:

* Check for duplicate triples.  This could be done by sorting the NT triples and looking for duplicates.
  These would not be a problem *per se*, but could expose areas where inconsistencies *could* crop up: if
  the same triple is generated in two or more places, they might not be guaranteed to be consistent.
* From the RDF generated by desc2014.xml:
    * Are there any allowableQualifier relations from descriptors that point to qualifiers that are not 
      defined in qual2014.xml?
    * Are there any SeeRelatedDescriptor/DescriptorReferredTo/DescriptorUI that are not defined in desc.xml?
* For entry combinations, make sure the ECIN: A, has a descriptor that matches the parent descriptor, and 
  B, has a qualifier.  Also, make sure that it includes an ECOUT descriptor. (ECOUT qualifier is optional).
* Likewise for every place that links from one resource to another resource that is defined/generated 
somewhere else, it would be a good idea to make sure that target resource is, in fact, defined.

* Verify that for descriptors, that their names match the preferred concept names, and that prefcon's preferred term's name.
